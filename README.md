# worklog
powershell worklog implementation

This is a powershell re-implementation of the worklog ideas originally developed by Erich Oberm√ºhlner (http://obermuhlner.ch).

The idea behind worklog is to have an easy way to capture a log of your spent time on different working tasks.
Based on the captured log one can create reports showing on what and how long it was worked on.
